# NextJS Users App

This is my first **NextJS** app, created to practice the implementation of its core features, including static site generation, dynamic routing, and API data fetching. Using the **jsonplaceholder** API, the application dynamically renders a list of users and their information. The app utilizes **getStaticPaths** and **getStaticProps** for static site generation to efficiently pre-render the pages at build time.
